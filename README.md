# Owl Nook

## Overview

### What is this website for?

The blog if for the user to find all kinds of information in one convenient place as well as share tips and funny things to the general internet.

### What does it do?

Reddit type blog full of all kinds of posts. This includes news, tips and posts just for laughs from memes to your next book to your next cocktail party type drinks. Users can posts or just browse what other people have posted. Unregistered users have very little access to content nad must join to view the entire post.

### How does it work

The website is going to be blog type layout. For those users who are there just to browse can expand on the post they are interested in but they will need to have an account to view the content. They can also save posts to read later. For those who love to share content they also need to have an account and can create posts and add photos at their own convenience. The website is built using the Django framework to handle creating user accounts and managing the website. The Postgres database is used to store general user data so that they can access their information later.

## UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### User Stories

#### As a user I want to be able to

- Register for an account so that I can comment, and like and view full content

- Leave comments on a post so that I can be involved in the conversation

- Upvote/Downvote posts so that I can interact with content

- Save posts so that I can access content easily at my own convenience

- Open posts so that I can read full text

- View the date/time of an individual post so that I can see which content is the most up to date.

- Add category to posts so that it is easier to find later.

- Filter posts so that it is easier to search

#### As Admin I was to be able to

- Approve Comments so that I can filter out objectionable comments

#### As User/Admin

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme was generated randomly using the [coolors](https://coolors.co/ffffff-b0b7bf-0e103d-f87575) generator. I wanted it to be a dark mode theme. Initially the generator started with 5 colours but they were too many. I reduced it to three (navy, coral and grey). When I began creating the mockups, the grey did not have enough contrast with the background, particularly with small text. As a result I added white to the colour palette.

#### Typography

The font used for headings and content text is Poppins, with a backup font of sans serif. The nature of the website means that there are sections where there will be a lot of text. Poppins is a font that looks good in large and small text and, the user can also easily distinguish letters. Depending on what the user posts, wether it be italic text for quotes, or title, The entire Poppins family of fonts and font weights will be available to the user.

#### Imagery

Blog images will be posted by a user. The user must post an image when posting a blog, otherwise a default image will be used. The default image is a woman sitting at a desk typing on a laptop on a ceramic desk.

#### Mockups

Mockups were made using Balsamiq Wireframes

[Mockup](./assets/planning/mockup-1.pdf)

#### Wireframes

- Wireframes were created using Adobe Xd, however, the layout and design was fallowed very loosely and changed during the mockup stage.

### Existing Features

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Common Features Across All Pages

- [x] **Header** - allows user to easily navigate across all pages

- Header is fixed to top of page for easy access (desktop and large tablets)
- Zimbabwe logo and text are positioned on the left and are links that take you to the homepage
- Navigation is place on the right on the logo for easy access (under logo for mobile)
- Navigation links change colour when hovered over. This lets the visitor know that it is clickable.
- Navigation link is underlined to let user know what page they are on
- Entire header disappears for mobile devices
- Colors have been chosen with optimum contrast in mind to be pleasant to the eye.
- [x] **Links** that are hovered over
- All links that are surrounding text have been underlined and change color when hovered over. This helps the user to identify external links. (except logo)
- [x] **Navigation banner**
- Navigation banner is the same across all pages to give uniformity and familiarity
- background image on home is scrollable to give a more fun user experience
- [x] **Accessibility**
- All images have aria labels in case they don't load and for the visually impaired
- [x] **Buttons**
- All buttons have the same styling and they invert colours when hovered (except for scroll to top button)
- [x] **Responsiveness**
- All pages work well with many screen sizes
- [x] **Footer**
- Footer sticks to the bottom of the page, regardless of the amount of content. This aids the overall user experience.
- All content have near uniform layout to give a nice and engaging flow of text and images
- Social links have been grouped together
- 'Contact us' is form for feedback and any question the user might have

### Specific to Pages

- [x] **Home Page**

- Image grid to easily see a handful of places the user can visit. When the mouse hovers you get addition information about the location

### Features Left to Implement

- Add a page where you can make a booking for a particular destinations. this includes adding a virtual online basket so that users can see what they have already selected (requires **Javascript** knowledge) For this reason I decided to remove the booking page from the website because it would be too incomplete and not provide a positive user experience.

- hide the scroll to top button at the beginning of page

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:

- Go to the "Contact Us" page
- Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
- Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
- Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

- ### Navigation bar

- When the logo or 'Zimbabwe' text is clicked, the user is redirected to the home page
- All links are working and have been tested.
- navigation bar is aligned vertically and under the logo for screens smaller than 660px
